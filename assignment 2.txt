main principle of SPLOM:
 - way of plotting multiple dimensions without loss of the orthogonality of axes
 - recognize easily correlated attributes


You need 1/2*n*(n-1) scatterplots for n attributes.

Advantages:
Every combination of two attributes is shown and in each scatterplot, the axes are orthogonal.
Therefore you can see correlations or anti-correlations easily.
It supports attribute visibility and you dont need interactive tools to understand the data (a 3d plot without interaction can sometimes be misleading).

Disadvantages:
As the number of scatterplots grows quadratically with the number of attributes, it gets big pretty fast.
As there are only combinations of 2 attributes, you cannot see relations between 3 or more attributes.
